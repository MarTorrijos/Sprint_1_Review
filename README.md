# Sprint 1 Review

Collection of exercises to review Java concepts from Sprint 1 at IT Academy

***

### About the project

Currently, there is only one exercise, and it is still in progress. More will be added soon >:D

The aim is to practice the following:
- Exceptions
- Collections (JCF)
- Testing
- Java Utils
- Generics
- Annotations
- Lambdas

I'm also incorporating new tools and techniques as they fit the exercises (for example, enums).

### Used:

- Java 23
- IntelliJ
