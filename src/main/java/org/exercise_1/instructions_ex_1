Task Management System
----------------------

Create a task management system that allows users to add tasks with different priority levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High),
mark them as completed, and categorize them (e.g., Work, Personal, Study). Use various Java features to implement this system.

Requirements:
    - Use Collections: Store the tasks in an appropriate collection (e.g., List, Set, Map).
    - Use Lambdas: Implement sorting and filtering based on different criteria
      (e.g., sorting tasks by priority, filtering completed tasks).
    - Use Exception Handling: Add exception handling for invalid operations
      (e.g., adding a task without a description, marking a task as completed when it's already completed).
    - Use Annotations: Create custom annotations for certain task categories
      (e.g., Work-related tasks could have a @Work annotation).
